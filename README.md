UPnP BHunter
===================

# Description
UPnP BHunter is a Burp Suite Extension written in Python/Jython which could be useful as UPnP penetration testing tool, to find active UPnP services/devices and extract the related SOAP, Subscribe and Presentation requests (IPv4 and IPv6 are supported), then analyze them using any of the various Burp tools (i.e. Intruder, Repeater).


# Installation
After downloaded the UPnP BHunter python file, start Burp Suite and click at the Extender tab on Add. Then choose the UPnP BHunter python file to install the extension.
Alternatively is possible to install it from official Burp App Store.


# Usage
UPnP BHunter provides a nice ;) three-step hunting console: 
1. UPnP Discovery (definition of target IP address version and discovery of active UPnP via SSDP protocol)
2. UPnP Selection (selection of the found UPnP service) 
3. UPnP Attack (extraction of the found UPnP SOAP, Subscribe and Presentation requests). 

The tutorial below explain, better than so many words, how to use the plugin:
